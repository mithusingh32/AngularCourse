<!-- 
1    Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
2    The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
3    When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
4    The event should be listenable from outside the component
5    When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
6    A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
7    Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
8    Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components -->
